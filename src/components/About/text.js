# About

Every citizen of the United States should be familiar with our political system.  Why do we have a congress, and what does it do?  What is free speech and why is it so important? These questions, and the fundamental philosophies that guide our democracy can be found in our founding documents. We should read them, understand them, question them and argue about their meaning and place in modern society.  This project provides a space for that.
